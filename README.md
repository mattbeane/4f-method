# The 4F Method
## Four-Function Fractal Software Development

> **Build complex software by recursively applying four simple functions until you can code.**

The 4F Method is a recursive approach to software development created by **Daniel Rock** that emphasizes complete specification before implementation. By applying four core functions fractally‚Äîfrom project level down to implementable components‚Äîyou achieve clarity, modularity, and build confidence before writing a single line of code.

## Why 4F?

**The Problem:** Jumping straight into coding complex systems leads to:
- Unclear requirements and scope creep
- Tangled architecture that's hard to modify
- Missing edge cases discovered too late
- Difficulty onboarding team members

**The 4F Solution:** Specify everything recursively first, then build bottom-up:
- ‚úÖ Complete clarity at every level before coding
- ‚úÖ Modular architecture emerges naturally
- ‚úÖ Test cases defined upfront
- ‚úÖ Implementation becomes straightforward execution

## The Four Functions

Apply these four functions at each level of your system:

### 1. `writeSpec()`
**What and Why**
- What needs to be built
- Why it exists (the problem it solves)
- Success criteria
- Inputs and outputs
- Non-functional requirements

### 2. `writeArchitecture()`
**How it's structured**
- Break down into sub-components
- Define data flow between components
- Identify dependencies
- Choose technologies/patterns

### 3. `writeTestingPlan()`
**How to verify it works**
- Unit test cases for each component
- Integration test scenarios
- Test fixtures and data
- Success/failure conditions

### 4. `writeInstructions()`
**How to implement it**
- Step-by-step implementation order
- Code examples and templates
- Gotchas and edge cases
- Performance considerations

## The Recursive Process

```
PROJECT LEVEL
‚îú‚îÄ writeSpec()          ‚Üí What is the whole system?
‚îú‚îÄ writeArchitecture()  ‚Üí Break into Modules
‚îú‚îÄ writeTestingPlan()   ‚Üí How to test the system?
‚îî‚îÄ writeInstructions()  ‚Üí Implementation phases
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ MODULE LEVEL (for each module)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ writeSpec()          ‚Üí What does this module do?
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ writeArchitecture()  ‚Üí Break into Sub-components
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ writeTestingPlan()   ‚Üí Module test plan
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ writeInstructions()  ‚Üí Component implementation
    ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ SUB-COMPONENT LEVEL (if needed)
    ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ writeSpec()
    ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ writeArchitecture()
    ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ writeTestingPlan()
    ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ writeInstructions()
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ STOP when components are simple enough to just code
```

**Key Insight:** Recurse as deep as needed. Stop when the task is small enough to implement directly from the instructions.

## Implementation Strategy

### Spec Phase (Top-Down)
1. Start at project level
2. Apply all 4 functions
3. Identify modules
4. Recurse into each module
5. Apply 4 functions again
6. Continue until components are implementable

### Build Phase (Bottom-Up)
1. Start with modules that have **no dependencies**
2. Implement following the instructions
3. Test thoroughly before moving up
4. Integrate modules layer by layer
5. Final system integration

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Project Setup
Create your project structure:
```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT-SPEC.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MODULE-1-[NAME].md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MODULE-2-[NAME].md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MODULE-3-[NAME].md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (implementation goes here)
```

### Step 2: Apply 4F at Project Level

**Example: PROJECT-SPEC.md**
```markdown
# My Project - Specification

## writeSpec()
### What We're Building
[Describe the system]

### Why This Exists
[The problem it solves]

### Success Criteria
1. [Measurable outcome 1]
2. [Measurable outcome 2]

### Inputs/Outputs
- Input: [What comes in]
- Output: [What goes out]

## writeArchitecture()
### Module Breakdown
- Module 1: [Name] - [Purpose]
- Module 2: [Name] - [Purpose]
- Module 3: [Name] - [Purpose]

### Data Flow
[Diagram or description]

## writeTestingPlan()
### Test Strategy
- Unit tests: [Approach]
- Integration tests: [Scenarios]
- Test fixtures: [What data]

## writeInstructions()
### Implementation Order
Phase 1: Build Module 3 (no dependencies)
Phase 2: Build Module 1
Phase 3: Build Module 2 (depends on 1, 3)
Phase 4: Integration
```

### Step 3: Recurse to Module Level

**Example: MODULE-1-NAME.md**
```markdown
# Module 1: [Name] - Specification

## writeSpec()
### What This Module Does
[Specific functionality]

### Why This Module Exists
[Its role in the system]

### Inputs/Outputs
- Input: [Data structures]
- Output: [Data structures]

## writeArchitecture()
### Sub-Components
1. Component A: [Purpose]
2. Component B: [Purpose]
3. Component C: [Purpose]

### Data Flow
[How data moves through components]

## writeTestingPlan()
### Component A Tests
- test_valid_input()
- test_invalid_input()
- test_edge_case()

### Component B Tests
[...]

## writeInstructions()
### Implementation Order
Step 1: Implement Component A
```python
def component_a(input):
    # Implementation guide
    pass
```

Step 2: Implement Component B
[...]
```

### Step 4: Implement Bottom-Up

Start with the module that has no dependencies:

```python
# Implement Module 3 first (depends on nothing)
# Test it thoroughly
# Then implement Module 1
# Test it thoroughly
# Then implement Module 2 (depends on 1 and 3)
# Test it thoroughly
# Finally, integration test
```

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This

1. **Be Complete, Not Perfect**: Specs don't need to be exhaustive, but should cover the essentials
2. **Stop at the Right Level**: Don't over-recurse. If you can implement it from the instructions, stop
3. **Build Dependencies First**: Always implement modules with no dependencies before dependent modules
4. **Test Each Layer**: Don't move up until current layer tests pass
5. **Keep Specs Updated**: If implementation reveals issues, update the spec

### ‚ùå Avoid This

1. **Don't Skip Functions**: All 4 functions matter at each level
2. **Don't Jump to Code**: Resist the urge to start coding before specs are done
3. **Don't Spec Too Deep**: Recursing to every tiny function defeats the purpose
4. **Don't Build Top-Down**: You'll have integration issues. Build bottom-up.
5. **Don't Abandon Specs**: They're living documentation, not write-once artifacts

## When to Use 4F

**Perfect for:**
- ‚úÖ Complex systems with multiple modules
- ‚úÖ Team projects (specs align everyone)
- ‚úÖ Learning new domains (specs force clarity)
- ‚úÖ High-stakes projects (catch issues early)
- ‚úÖ AI-assisted coding (gives AI clear instructions)

**Overkill for:**
- ‚ùå Simple scripts (<100 lines)
- ‚ùå Prototypes/experiments
- ‚ùå Well-understood patterns you've done 100x

## Working with AI (Like Claude)

The 4F Method works exceptionally well with AI coding assistants:

### AI + 4F Workflow

1. **You write the specs** (or work with AI to write them)
2. **AI helps with architecture** (suggests module breakdowns)
3. **You define test cases** (AI can help generate edge cases)
4. **AI implements from instructions** (straightforward execution)

### Why This Works

- AI excels at implementation when given clear specs
- Reduces hallucination (everything is specified)
- Easy to verify (tests are pre-defined)
- Iterative refinement (update specs, regenerate code)

### Example Prompt

```
I'm using the 4F Method. Here's my MODULE-2 spec:

[paste spec]

Please implement Component A following the instructions in
writeInstructions(). The tests are defined in writeTestingPlan().
```

## FAQ

### Q: How long does the spec phase take?

**A:** Usually 20-30% of total project time. A project that would take 10 hours to code might take 2-3 hours to spec fully. But you save that time (and more) by avoiding rework.

### Q: Can I use 4F for existing projects?

**A:** Yes! Apply it to new modules or when refactoring. Create specs for what exists, then recurse for new components.

### Q: What if requirements change?

**A:** Update the specs at the appropriate level, then regenerate affected code. The modular structure makes changes easier to isolate.

### Q: Do I always need all 4 functions?

**A:** For complete clarity, yes. But for tiny components, you might combine them. The key is having answers to: What? How? How to test? How to implement?

### Q: How deep should I recurse?

**A:** Until you can implement directly from the instructions. If you're writing pseudo-code that's basically real code, you've gone deep enough.

## Get Started

1. **Copy the templates** above
2. **Pick a project** (start small!)
3. **Apply 4F at project level** (all 4 functions)
4. **Recurse to modules** (all 4 functions again)
5. **Stop when implementable** (don't over-spec)
6. **Build bottom-up** (dependencies first)
7. **Test each layer** (green tests before moving up)

**Remember:** The goal is clarity, not perfection. Spec enough to code confidently, then ship.

üöÄ **Happy building with 4F!**
